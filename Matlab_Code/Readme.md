These files are all MATLAB scripts which either create the input files (called write*.m) or read out the output of FortSEIR codes (called read*.m).
There are also scripts which read specific sheets of the Prem et al., 2017 matrices to read out the country specific contact matrices. Please
feel free to add stuff to the functionalities in these scripts on your own thread or write new scripts to do other cool things!
